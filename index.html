		<h1>Ally</h1>
		<div>
			<p>
				Ally, also known as Alex or Rez, is A well known pro Widwomaker, as well as a pro Mercy. Unfortunately, she belongs to a species known as 
				<i>Homo Sapiens Sapiens</i>. While the name literally means wize wize person, it is a slightly inaccurate name. Humans are endowed with 
				fears and insecurities that hold them back. This is true for all humans without exception. Ally is no exception, as she has the misinformed
				human conception that her hair is ugly. What she fails to understand is that the concept of "ugly" is inherantly subjective, making it an
				objective fact that some may view it differently. However, as I am also human, I fail to see the objective truth that it may be seen as
				ugly by anyone. Because of this I have the set plan in my mind to beat the living shit out of anyone who could ever say her hair is ugly.
				However this creates a paradox, as I would obviously never consider inflicting such a barbaric and pointless act on Ally, but she falls
				under the catagory of people who believe that her hair is ugly. Because of this I have decided on the comprimise of destroying her in
				Overwatch, as I am a pro Hanzo who can literally never be defeated.
